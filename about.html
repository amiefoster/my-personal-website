        <h1>Get to Know Me!</h1>

        <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
        <p>My coding journey began in 2020. Like so many people, I had lost my job due to the pandemic and suddenly had an abundance of free time on my hands. I thought that coding would be a good way to pick up a new skill and keep myself busy during quarantine. I started learning HTML and CSS with free online resources like Codecademy, and freeCodeCamp. Soon after, I realized that this was something I wanted to do as a career and began to look into how I could turn my new hobby into a profession! Thatâ€™s when I found coding bootcamps. After more research and studying, a few months later I was accepted into Flatiron's software engineering program that I will be starting August 30th. I am very excited to begin this new journey and cant wait to see where coding takes me. </p>

        <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
        <p>Apart from coding, I love staying active, watching movies, reading, traveling, attending concerts, and listening to podcasts. I stay pretty active and workout about five times a week. I enjoy hiking and try to do at least one hike a month. I love traveling and experiencing different cultures, cities, and food! I am probably the least picky eater on the planet and I love to try new food! True crime podcasts are my guilty pleasure, but I also love listening to people talk about their life experiences on shows like Armchair Expert. PLEASE free to reach out with movie, music, book, and podcast suggestions. I'm all ears! 
        </p>

        <h3>Where I Come From</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Southern California, but I recently made to move to Utah with my family. Its been great to experience living somewhere new and the many hiking trails in my backyard. After I finish the Flatiron program I plan to move to a bigger city. Maybe somewhere with seasons since I've never experienced that?
